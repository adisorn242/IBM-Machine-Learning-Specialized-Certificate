Since it is based on KNN, it inherits the main characteristics of KNN such as memory-intensive because you need to maintain a huge similarity matrix among users or items. In the future labs, we will learn other types of collaborative filtering which do not rely on such a huge similarity matrix to make rating predictions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d5fd0714-e3ae-4de5-be24-83420ea66665"},"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"960f6e88-5df4-456f-85f4-f6729ea17fe3"},"source":["[Yan Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-luo-96288783/)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"887b883d-e5c7-4f06-8a9c-a05211eb462f"},"source":["### Other Contributors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"79d79a4c-d648-47e7-ba0c-c6055f9a7741"},"source":["```toggle## Change Log\n","```\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2c6f7c86-838d-438b-8374-8044a04e8f4d"},"source":["```toggle|Date (YYYY-MM-DD)|Version|Changed By|Change Description|\n","```\n","```toggle|-|-|-|-|\n","```\n","```toggle|2021-10-25|1.0|Yan|Created the initial version|\n","```\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python","language":"python","name":"conda-env-python-py"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"prev_pub_hash":"155ca510415f0c86629879a1a8087e0d13be058c4d6afd98f04ebd5a465566b6","colab":{"provenance":[],"machine_shape":"hm"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
